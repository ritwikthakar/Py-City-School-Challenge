# School District Analysis

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor about the evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. Maria has asked to replace the math and reading scores for 9th Graders in Thomas High School to be omitted while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once this function is complete, Maria has asked to repeat the school district analysis that you did and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
